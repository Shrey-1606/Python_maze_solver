# Python_maze_solver

This is a basic level python based maze solver, it has a certain format of maze_map.txt it works with it. Only works for maze having unique solution and also gives a visual output of how the maze is solved. It can work with any given rectangular matrix.

Example of input:

What special about this code? :

It sticks to very basic level python which might be inefficient but shows how even simple if else statements can make a maze solver. 
The output looks fancy and visually understandable of how maze_solver solved it, I am also looking to add colours to the barriers and the path direction and normal elements as well. 


Example of output:

Limitations: 

1. Only works with the format given
2. Needs a unique solution, multiple solutions are not yet supported
3. Works in a single priority order of North, East, South, West

Bug: 

1. The direction of 2nd last element to the goal is not shown in output for some reason. Working around to fix this.
